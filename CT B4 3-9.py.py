    Program Goals:
    1. Get input from the user (at multiple points)
    2. We need to convert some of this input to INTs from STRs
    3. We need to provide choices to the user 
        a. Add more values to a list
        b. Return a value at a specific index

    mainProgram()
    We start with a while True statement so that the whole code runs until stopped.
    Next we have a try and except statement which we uses as a simple error messaging system. 
    Then we give an input that gives a list of all the options for doing things with their list.
    Then we have an if statement, a bunch of elif statements, and an else statement that detects what this input is and runs the corresponding code. 
    The else statement is there so that if any number that is not detected by the if or elif statements make it stop the code.

    addAFew()
    First, we have a while true statement which makes the code inside of it run until told to stop.
    Then we give an input that like addToList adds the input to myList but because of the while loop, it will continue to let you add numbers. 
    Next, we have an if statement that checks to see if the input is stop and if it is it will end the while loop if not it will just continue.

    First, we have a for loop which looks at each item in myList.
    Then there is an if statement that says if the number that is being looked at is not already in uique_list add it to it.
    It goes through every item in the list then it sorts the list in numerical order.
    Next, we have an input that asks if you want to see the list and if you type Y it will show it to you if it is anything else it will take it as an N.

    sortListNoDis()
    This is very similar to sortList in the way that it goes through myList and adds items to unique_list if they are not already in there. 
    The difference is that it does not display anything and it is just used along with other functions, not on its own.

    Here we use the random liberty to get a random value and show that index postion. 
    The way we do that is by taking the length of mylist and subtract 1 then we finding a random number between the length and 0 and print that index position.

    First, we give an input to determine the number that is being looked for. 
    Then we have a for loop which makes it so that it will check every item in the list. 
    Then using x as our variable we go through the list and if x is equal to the imputed number it prints a message that gives you the index position of that number.

    recursiveBinarySearch()
    This function uses sortListNoDis to make sure that the list is sorted before it runs because if it is not sorted it does not work.
    We start with an if statement that checks to make sure that the highest value is greater than or equal to the lowest value.
    Then it finds the middle value by adding the highest value and the lowest value then dividing them by 2.
    Then it checks to see if the middle value is equal to x which is an input that is initiated in mainProgram. 
    If the middle value is equal to x then it prints a message that tells you that index position.
    If it is not the middle value it checks to see if mid is greater than x if it is then it makes mid - 1 the new high value.
    If not then means that mid is less than x and it makes mid + 1 the new low value and it contim=nues until mid = x.

    iterativeBinarySearch()
    This function uses sortListNoDis to make sure that the list is sorted before it runs because if it is not sorted it does not work.
    First, it sets low and mid values to 0 and high value to the length of unique_list - 1.
    Then it has a while loop which makes the code run until stopped and it stops when low is not less than or equal to high.
    Then similarly to recursiveBinarySearch, it goes through and changes the value of mid depending on if mid is less than or greater than x.
    Then once low is not less than or equal to high it returns -1 which triggers code to run in mainProgram. 
    What that does is it prints out the index location of where it stopped which is the index position of x.

    If there are none it prints myList.

    This function is not used on its own it is used in other functions to make the code smaller.
    First, it starts by giving an input that asks what number you want to delete.
