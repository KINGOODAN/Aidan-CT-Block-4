9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.

In 9th grade, I did nothing with coding. I wish that I had some so that I was not as far behind as I was at the beginning of the year.


10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).

In Block 1 we made a game that incorporated both the card dealing game we had made and the dice game we made. In Block 2 we made Videos talking about abstraction and VR. For my Passion Project, Myles and I made a discord bot with 15+ functions that will be added to Mr. Best's Discord server soon.


What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?

I would like to improve my overall knowledge of Python.


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel challenges you more than others?

My lack of prior knowledge.


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.

One of my big goals with coding is that I can just use it in my life whether that be a career like Blizzard or apple or just making my life easier at another job.
